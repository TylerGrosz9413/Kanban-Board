# Kanban-Board

A Kanban board built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The board has 4 categories, 'Backlog', 'In Progress', 'Complete', and 'On Hold'. It allows the user to create tasks by clicking on the 'Add Item' button, edit items by clicking on the item and typing in the new title, delete items by clicking the item, deleting the text inside and then clicking away, and move items to different buckets by dragging and dropping them to the new bucket.
